## How to Play

   1. Starting the Game: The game begins as soon as you click the "Roll" button or when you click on a die to freeze it at its current value.

   2. Rolling the Dice: Click the "Roll" button to roll all the dice that are not held. You can also click on individual dice to freeze them and prevent them from rolling. Your objective is to make all the dice show the same number.

   3. Winning: You win the game when all the dice are held and they all show the same value.

   4. Tracking Your Performance: The game keeps track of the number of rolls and the time taken to win. You can see this information on the screen.

   5. High Score: There is also a high score feature that keeps track of the best performance in terms of the number of rolls, time, and the value achieved.
